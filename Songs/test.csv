And misty memories of days gone by

Through these suburban streets  
Make love to these women

Where nothing ever happened?

Lightweights stepping aside,  
When we come in.  
Feel it in your chest,

People on the street,  
They panic and start running.  
Words on loose leaf,  
Sheet complete coming.  
I jump on my mind,  
I summon the rhyme I'm dumping.  
Healing the blind,  
I promise to let the sun in.  
Sick of the dark ways,

Like it's stupid standing for  
What I'm standing for.  
Like this war is really just  
A different brand of war.  
Like it doesn't cater the rich  
And an abandon the poor.  
Like they understand you  
In the back of the jet,  
When you can't put gas in your tank.  
These fuckers are laughing their way  
To the bank and cashing their check  
Asking you to have compassion and to have some respect.  
  
For a leader so nervous  
In an obvious way  
Stuttering and mumbling  
For nightly news to replay  
And the rest of the world  
Watching at the end of the day  
In the living room laughing  
Like what did he say?  
  
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen  
  
In my living room watching,  
But I am not laughing.  
'Cause when it gets tense,  
I know what might happen.  
The world is cold,  
The bold men take action.  
Have to react,  
Or get blown into fractions.  
Ten years old is something to see,  
Another kid my age drugged under a jeep,  
Taken and bound and found later under a tree,  
I wonder if he thought the ""next one could be me"".  
Do you see?  
The soldiers they're out today.  
That brush the dust from bulletproof vests away.  
It's ironic,  
At times like this you pray,  
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday.  
There's bombs in the buses, bikes, roads,  
Inside your markets, your shops, your clothes,  
My dad, he's got a lot of fear I know  
But enough pride inside not to let that show.  
My brother had a book he would hold with pride  
A little red cover with a broken spine.  
In the back he hand wrote a quote inside,  
When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die.  
  
Meanwhile, the leader just talks away  
Stuttering and mumbling  
For nightly news to replay  
And the rest of the world  
Watching at the end of the day  
Both scared and angry  
Like what did he say?  
  
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen.

So I can get me somethin' to eat  
My clothes are ragged, no shoes on my feet""  
Said the little paper boy, there on the street  
  
""Out in this cold wide world all alone  
I have no place on this earth to call home  
I haven't had the chance that other kids had  
I have no mother, nor even a dad""

Said the little paper boy, there on the street  
  
Early next mornin' as the crowd passed by  
The little boy was gone and they wondered why  
They started searchin' and then found him dead  
He died with the papers under his head  
  
No one was there, his body to claim  
There he was lying but he felt no pain  
Now he has gone up to Heaven we know  
The little paper boy who died in the snow  
  
There ya have it, friends

Will shine again in grace  
Then why do we keep strangling life  
Wound this earth, crucify its soul

Create a world with no fear

See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

No hungry children, no empty hand  
One happy morning people will share

Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears  
All men are equal and no men have fears

From our world today

Someday in a world where men are free

Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
You've started back doing the things you used to do.  
  
As I was motivatin' over the hill  
I saw Maybellene in a coup de ville.  
A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road,  
Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford.  
The Cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five,  
She's bumper to bumper rollin' side by side.  
  
Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
You've started back doing the things you used to do.  
  
Pink in the mirror on top of the hill,  
It's just like swallowin' up a medicine pill.  
First thing I saw that Cadillac grille  
Doin' a hundred and ten gallopin' over that hill.  
Offhill curve, a downhill stretch,  
Me and that Cadillac neck by neck.  
  
Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
You've started back doing the things you used to do.  
  
The Cadillac pulled up ahead of the Ford,  
The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more.  
It then got clody and it started to rain,  
I tooted my horn for a passin' lead  
The rain water blowin' all under my hood,  
I knew that was doin' my motor good.  
  
Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
You've started back doing the things you used to do.  
  
The motor cooled down, the heat went down  
And that's when I heard that highway sound.  
The Cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead  
A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead.  
The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still  
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill.  
  
Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
You've started back doing the things you used to do.

107 light years away

I will miss you, children of the sun  
But it's time to go away  
Goodbye milky way  
  
For a better world without hate  
Follow your heart, believe in fate  
Only visions and the mind  
Will guide you to the light

Andromeda galaxy will collide with our milky way  
A new gigantic Cosmic world will be born

We'd roll and fall in green.  
You had a temper like my jealousy:  
Too hot, too greedy.  
How could you leave me,  
When I needed to possess you?  
I hated you. I loved you, too.  
  
Bad dreams in the night.  
They told me I was going to lose the fight,  
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering

Ooh, it gets dark! It gets lonely,  
On the other side from you.  
I pine a lot. I find the lot  
Falls through without you.  
I'm coming back, love.  
Cruel Heathcliff, my one dream,  
My only master.  
  
Too long I roam in the night.  
I'm coming back to his side, to put it right.  
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering,
