    "\n",
    "Evidently, although Jaccard is faster in performance, its output return is much less comparable to TF-IDF + cosine similarity.<br> This is because titles consist of very few words, while lyrics contain many more words, making the overlap too small to generate meaningful scores. <br>In contrast, TF-IDF + cosine similarity can pick up patterns through repeated words, and TF-IDF assigns higher weights to rare or important words, <br>making it more sensitive to meaningful overlap between a title and lyrics."
