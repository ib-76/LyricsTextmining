Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
You've started back doing the things you used to do.  
  
As I was motivatin' over the hill  
I saw Maybellene in a coup de ville.  
A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road,  
Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford.  
The Cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five,  
She's bumper to bumper rollin' side by side.  
  
Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
You've started back doing the things you used to do.  
  
Pink in the mirror on top of the hill,  
It's just like swallowin' up a medicine pill.  
First thing I saw that Cadillac grille  
Doin' a hundred and ten gallopin' over that hill.  
Offhill curve, a downhill stretch,  
Me and that Cadillac neck by neck.  
  
Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
You've started back doing the things you used to do.  
  
The Cadillac pulled up ahead of the Ford,  
The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more.  
It then got clody and it started to rain,  
I tooted my horn for a passin' lead  
The rain water blowin' all under my hood,  
I knew that was doin' my motor good.  
  
Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
You've started back doing the things you used to do.  
  
The motor cooled down, the heat went down  
And that's when I heard that highway sound.  
The Cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead  
A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead.  
The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still  
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill.  
  
Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
You've started back doing the things you used to do.

6291538727295026626,Why We Thugs,"Yeah  
Every hood's the same  
Every hood's the same  
C'mon  
  
The give us guns and drugs,  
They wonder why we fuck wit thugs,  
They want to count the slugs,  
Ain't come around here and fuck wit us,  
The give us guns and drugs,  
They wonder why we fuck wit thugs,  
They want to count the slugs,  
Ain't come around here and fuck wit us,  
  
I'm from the man wit the gang bang,  
Since I was little ain't a god damn thing changed,  
Its the same old same,  
On some bad shit like Saddam Hussein,  
Cock and aim, clinically insane,  
To deal wit dis bullshit day-to-day  
If I sell some yey, smoke some hay,  
You bitches wanna throw me in Helekin's Bay  
Call me an animal up in the system,  
But who's the animal who built this prison,  
Who's the animal who invented lord-livin',  
The projects?, thank god for Russel Simmons,  
Thank God for Sugah Hill,  
I'm puttin' a different type of steel up to my grill,  
Yall know what it is, here for ya home kids,  
How these lil' niggas takin' over show-biz,  
  
The give us guns and drugs,  
They wonder why we fuck wit thugs,  
They want to count the slugs,  
Ain't come around here and fuck wit us,  
The give us guns and drugs,  
They wonder why we fuck wit thugs,  
They want to count the slugs,  
Ain't come around here and fuck wit us,  
  
There's boys in tha hood, there's toys in tha hood,  
Ya'll wanna know why there's noise in tha hood,  
Cause there's guns in the hood, drugs in the hood,  
Nigga killed the crips and the blood in the hood,  
Cause when niggas get tried, survivable, nobody liable,  
I got caught by 5-0, grandmama came to court wit her bible,  
But when the judge hit the gavel, too far from my family to travel,  
I just came unraveled, came to the d.a. before I got daffeled,  
State my c.a., state property, just like the kid 15-53,  
Lookin' for me, a one-way ticket out,  
Don't know whats so hard to figure out,  
  
The give us guns and drugs,  
They wonder why we fuck wit thugs,  
They want to count the slugs,  
Ain't come around here and fuck wit us,  
The give us guns and drugs,  
They wonder why we fuck wit thugs,  
They want to count the slugs,  
Ain't come around here and fuck wit us,  
  
Damn I can't take tha pressure, pulled tha fo-fo out the dress'a  
Grabbed away, out the closet, popo comin' but I'm scare to toss it,  
Ya'll know what happened last time I lossed it,  
Can't tell you niggas what the fuckin' boss did,  
G-game got the brotha exhausted, gotta go for the the big bargain they off it  
Twenty yea's fo' what, these laws are so corrupt,  
Takin' these halls and fill them up, some politicin' shit they bout to erupt,  
This shit is horrible stuff, until the year two thousand-what the fuck,  
In the hood don't press ya luck, cause these muthafuckas will set you up,  
Word up  
  
The give us guns and drugs,  
They wonder why we fuck wit thugs,  
They want to count the slugs,  
Ain't come around here and fuck wit us,  
The give us guns and drugs,  
They wonder why we fuck wit thugs,  
They want to count the slugs,  
Ain't come around here and fuck wit us,

It's so frustratin, so many hatin  
Somebody gon' make me break the law  
But I ain't waitin, there's no escapin  
You better get ready for the war  
  
A shotgun fanatic, who right back at it  
You get, mopped and dropped like a filthy habit  
X, snatch and grab it, got you hopin I fail  
Cause if I fail you'd be happy like a faggot in jail  
I'm full retail, guaranteed to sell  
In my jet black McClaren with my mademoiselle  
I'm strong-arm steady, you fragile and frail  
You think you ready for them steady niggaz? I can't tell  
Sex sells so fuck you all, we came to bubble and ball  
You getting shutd own soon as I touch down  
Bust rounds, enemies slayed and cut down  
Fully automatic spittin rounds with no sound  
Break down your whole regime, like an M-16  
Make sure the chamber in the barrel is clean  
And the spring that's connected to the firin pin  
That's connected to the trigger when I squeeze it again, begin  
  
Look ma top of the world, the best of the best  
King California, L-A-X  
Out the hood, in the penthouse, from the projects  
One man, one gun, how the West was won - sing!

But I ain't waitin, there's no escapin  
You better get ready for the war  
  
Hit like a heavyweight, breathe deep, meditate  
Make the whole crowd get loud, make 'em levitate  
I ride through my city like a presidential candidate  
L-A-X, Phantom double-are, and accelerate  
Stack build elevate, crash through the prison gate  
Generation hate, appetite to eliminate  
X-Man don't spit rhymes, I ventilate  
Traffic contraband, yeah banned through the interstate  
Got a sick flow - didn't know? Let me demonstrate  
Renovate the game, new nigga that you love to hate  
The left hand lands and the right hand devastates  
Half part of your face replaced with a metal plate  
Irate, get snatched to a better place  
Let the detached decorate with the yellow tape  
Detonate, drop bombs, make the earth shake  
In Brazil with a half mill' in the briefcase  
  
Look ma top of the world, the best of the best  
King California, L-A-X  
Out the hood, in the penthouse, from the projects  
One man, one gun, how the West was won - sing!

7693101070296471068,Best of Things,"[Xzibit]  
I was voted most likely to have a psychiatric evaluation  
Let's start the process of elimination  
This dedication is for niggaz with the green buddha  
The bandula, six-shooter to your suit coolers  
Now how this feel? Cold black steel up in your grill  
This hollow point lead gon' be your last meal  
Say your prayers, say your graces  
Pieces of your face is found in a hundred different places  
Huh, so what we lookin like? We tryin to see some hoes to fuck tonight  
and you just tryin to see the afterlife  
Make a decision before we have a head-on collision  
makin me spend the rest of my life in prison  
See I can only play the cards I was given  
Multiplication division whatever you got to break mines off  
like the U.S. government did to Microsoft  
Like Xzibit in some pussy with the lights turned off  
It's like  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm just livin to fulfill my dreams  
I'm just tryin to have the best of things  
None of y'all can't take shit from me  
Life's a bitch she ain't fuckin for free  
So I'ma ride til the wheels fall off  
while all the rest get weak and go soft  
Your petite style, can get you beat down  
My heat's loud, have you huggin on the street now  
  
[Xzibit]  
Niggaz keep askin me how does it feel  
How does WHAT feel? Not havin to scrape for a meal?  
Not bein locked down to a fucked up deal?  
The biggest man in Los Angeles is not Shaquille  
We had to reinvent the wheel, draft new blueprints  
Made a whole album, spent HALF what you spent  
then sent the rest to my people to invest wit it  
Custom fitted, if you want it nigga, come and get it  
and I suggest you bring a million niggaz runnin wit it  
Split it, feel it, hit it it's hot, look  
I ain't gon' stop til everybody's shot  
Muammar Khadaf's the dot, X mark the spot  
with an infrared to your head, left for dead  
Fuck the feds, flee the country then grow some dreads (ya mon)  
I suggest you keep your distance, for instance, the same distance  
it takes to get to the next solar system, motherfucker  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Xzibit]  
Strike one, when a nigga talkin shit with his hands  
Strike two, gettin caught in the wrong place with your pants down  
Strike three, tryin to fuck with the D-O-double-G  
D-are-E, or any of my Alkaholik family  
Huh, Xzibit turn your vital signs to a straight line  
Never seen a dog bite and bark at the same time  
Restless, rugged, never relaxed  
Permanently owe you motherfuckers backs like tax  
Baseball bats and breaks upside of your head  
Homey STILL gettin swoll off water and bread  
I got this, retaliation, for any situation I'm facin  
and leave the stage with a standin ovation, it's like  
  
[Chorus]
