You seh a me you like  
You seh mi n you would be really nice  
Seh you have a reason fi be my wife  
Seh you wanna really get love fi life  
Money me love n I love my life  
Matrimony nanny is my wife  
Mi deh wid a bank account weh mi like  
NCB, Nova Scotia choice  
  
When di thugs dem hustle in di streets  
Everyone a hide from police jeep  
Deh pon di road when yuh sleep  
This is not nuh love of nuh lady  
The love of money  
The love of money  
I'm in love with money  
  
Mi check for you my girl  
But you still can't get first place  
When mi wek up inna di morning  
Nanny affi a look inna mi face  
If mi na mi have pound Sterling  
Di queen mi want fi embrace  
She divorce Benjamin Franklin  
A mi move har inna my place, laing  
Mi nuh want no gyal weh normal  
Mi want di American dream  
If mi go England  
Mi nah role normal  
Mi rolling wid di queen  
Taurus Riley seh she's so royal  
Married to nanny don't illegal  
Any woman deh pon money she a my gyal  
When di thugs dem hustle in di streets  
Everyone a hide from police jeep  
Deh pon di road when yah sleep  
This is not nuh love of nuh lady  
The love of money  
The love of money  
The love of money  
  
Notnice when danger from waterford drive in  
Dem seh Nanny boyfriend inna di scheme  
Every English hustler I know what mi mean  
When mi bawl out long live the queen  
Got mi clarks shoe dem cya lean  
And mi want Versace straight jeans  
Mi favourite colour a di red inna di pound  
And USA money cream, pimp pimp  
  
Mi nuh want no gyal weh normal  
Mi want di American dream  
If mi go England  
Mi nah role normal  
Mi rolling wid di queen  
Taurus Riley seh she's so royal  
Married to nanny don't illegal  
Any woman deh pon money she a my gyal  
When di thugs dem hustle in di streets  
Everyone a hide from police jeep  
Deh pon di road when yah sleep  
This is not nuh love of nuh lady  
The love of money  
The love of money  
The love of money

10528770166993144871,Voglio restare cosi,"Voglio restare cosi,  
Magari fino in fondo,  
Il mondo attorno ormai  
Non mi interessa piu.  
Mi basta averti qui  
E stringerti cosi.  
  
Mi basta un gesto tuo  
Un sorriso,  
Una parola,  
E un attimo cosi  
Vale un'eternita  
Accendi un fuoco e poi  
Restiamo soli!  
Noi.  
  
[English: ""I Want To Stay Like This""]  
I want to stay like this  
If possible to the end  
By now the world around  
No longer interests me  
It is enough that you are here  
And I hold you like this  
  
A gesture from you is enough  
A smile,  
A word,  
And a moment like this  
Is worth an eternity.  
Light a fire and then  
Let's be alone!  
Us.
